2) Create some news records on a sysfolder.
3) Create a plugin on a page and select at least the sysfolder as startingpoint.

### 4.3. Release Management

News uses **semantic versioning** which basically means for you, that
- **bugfix updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bugfixes or security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
- **minor updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks without breaking changes.
- **major updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes wich can be refactorings, features or bugfixes.

### 4.4. Contribution

**Pull requests** are welcome in general! Nevertheless please don't forget to add an issue and connect it to your pull requests. This
is very helpful to understand what kind of issue the **PR** is going to solve.

- Bugfixes: Please describe what kind of bug your fix solve and give us feedback how to reproduce the issue. We're going
to accept only bugfixes if I can reproduce the issue.
- Features: Not every feature is relevant for the bulk of ``news`` users. In addition: We don't want to make ``news``
even more complicated in usability for an edge case feature. Please discuss a new feature before.
