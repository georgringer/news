Switch to GitHub
----------------
GitHub is now used as platform for this extension. The repository has moved to `https://github.com/georgringer/news`. The following things are changing:

**Clone**

Please use now `git@github.com:georgringer/news.git` or `https://github.com/georgringer/news.git` to clone the repository.

The repository `github.com/TYPO3-extensions/news` has been removed!

**Issues**

Please create issues at https://github.com/georgringer/news/issues, as the forge project will not be used anymore in the future.

Features
--------

PreHydrate signal for the import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new signal slot has been added which can be used to manipulate the import data before it is actually used.

Hide the page tree for the admin module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new option in the Extension Manager can be used to hide the page tree for the administration module.
In combination with the TsConfig setting `tx_news.redirectToPageOnStart = 123` this can be used to build a very simple editor interface.
