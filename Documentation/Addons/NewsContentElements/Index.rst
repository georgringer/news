EXT:news_content_elements
=========================

Extending a news record by additional content elements makes it possible to enrich an article by any content elements.
The only drawback is that the management of those is kind of limited because of using the so called IRRE - inline record rendering type.

This extension gives editors the possibility to use the power of page module for editing the content elements of a specific record.
