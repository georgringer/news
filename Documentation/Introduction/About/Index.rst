technologies which are provided by the TYPO3 CMS.

**Best practise from the scratch**

- Based on extbase & fluid
- Easy to use & understand for editors
- Using as many elements from the core as possible, e.g. FAL and sys categories
- Checkbox "Top news" to flag important news
- Built in support for content elements
- Support for opengraph and social platforms in default template

.. hint::
   *A quote about EXT:news:* It is a highly customizable framework for chronological organized content - much more than just a news list!
