Say thanks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the extension has been developed in unpaid free time which
could have been spent in so many other ways too. If you like this
extension, it would be awesome if you could do one (or all) of the
following proposals:

- **Say thanks** to the developers. You can use emails or make it public at
  the mailinglist  *typo3.projects.tt-news* . Most of us are at plenty of
  TYPO3 events if you want to meet us in person.
- **Spread the word!** If you like this extension, tell your friends,
  colleagues,... about it.
- **Donate!** If you use this extension in your paid projects and you and your
  clients are happy with it, think about donating a small amount.
  Get in contact with me for details.
