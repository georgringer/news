Known problems
--------------

news works only with latest TYPO3 versions. This is no real problem
but still should be mentioned as it wont be changed in the future.

The bugtracker at `http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-
news/issues <http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-news/issues>`_
holds all known bugs. If you think you have found a bug, please report
(if not already done) at forge and attach at least those information
to make it as easy as possible to resolve it:

- Understandable title & description: Please use English and include how
  the bug can be reproduced

- TYPO3 & news version

- Of course an attached patch is awesome but not a must.
