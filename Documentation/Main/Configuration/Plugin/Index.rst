Plugin
^^^^^^^^^

The most important configuration settings can be done through the
settings of a plugin. As not every configuration is needed for every
view, the not needed are hidden.

Because of using Extbase every setting can also be done by using
TypoScript but remember that the settings of the plugin always
override the ones from TypoScript.
