How to add a simple news system to your site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This walkthrough will help you to implement the extension news at your
TYPO3 installation.


Installation
""""""""""""

The extension needs to be installed as any other extension of TYPO3:

#. Switch to the module “Extension Manager”.

#. Get the extension

   #. **Get it from the Extension Manager:** Press the “Retrieve/Update”
      button and search for the extension key  *news* and import the
      extension from the repository.

   #. **Get it from typo3.org:** You can always get current version from
      `http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/news/current/
      <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/news/current/>`_ by
      clicking on the link “Download compressed extension .T3X file”. Upload
      the file in the Extension Manager.

#. The Extension Manager offers some basic configuration which is
   explained in a later chapter. You can ignore those for the 1 :sup:`st`
   moment.


Latest version from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get the latest version from git by using the git command::

   git clone git://git.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Extensions/news.git


Preparation: Include static TypoScript
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Be aware that before any plugin can be rendered in the frontend it is
necessary to include the static TypoScript of news. This is very easy:

#. Switch to the template module and to the your template record.

#. Add the news extension to the “Include Static” list as shown in the
   screenshot

Create the records
""""""""""""""""""

Before any news record can be shown in the frontend those need to be
created.

#. Therefore create a new sysfolder and switch to the list module. (Of
   course you can also use an existing sysfolder or normal page).

#. Use the icon in the topbar “Create new record” and search for “News
   system” and its records. You should see “News”, “News category” and
   “News Tag”.

   #. Click on “News category” to create a new category. Insert as many
      categories as you want and use the field “Parent Category” to build up
      a category tree.

   #. Click on “News” to create a new news record. Fill as many fields you
      want to field, a required one is only the header.


Add a plugin to a page
""""""""""""""""""""""

Follow this steps to add a plugin to a page:

#. Create a new page “Detail” which will be used to show the full news
   record. Insert the plugin “News system”. The 2 :sup:`nd` tab “Plugin”
   is used to configure the extension.

#. Add a new content element and select the entry “News system”

|img-9|

#. Switch to the tab “Plugin” where you can define the plugin's settings.
   The most important settings are “What to display” and “Startingpoint”.

   #. Change the 1 :sup:`st` select box “What to display” to “Detail view”.

   #. Save the plugin.

#. Create a new page “List” (or however you want to name it) and insert
   the plugin “News system” there again.

   #. The selected view is already “List view”. This is fine.

   #. Fill the field “Startingpoint” by selecting the sysfolder you created
      in the beginning of the tutorial.

   #. Switch to the 2 :sup:`nd` tab “Additional” and fill the field “PageId
      for single news display” with the page you just created before.

   #. Save the plugin.


Check the frontend
""""""""""""""""""

Load the List page in the frontend and you should see the news records
as output. A click on the title should show the news record on the
detail page.

         It is possible to create different list showing different fields of
         the news record. The syntax is very simple::

            <LIST-TITLE-1>=<FIELD1>,<FIELD2>;<LIST-TITLE-2>=<FIELD2>,<FIELD3>,<FIELD4>;

         You can use a normal string as title or a translatable string from a
         locallang file by using the common syntax
         LLL:path/to/file/locallang.xml:key.

         If no field list is set, no records are shown in the page module.
