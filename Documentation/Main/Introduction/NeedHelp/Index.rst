Need help?
^^^^^^^^^^

Mailing-list
""""""""""""

If you need help with the news extension, you can always ask in the
public mailinglist  *typo3.projects.news* .

If you got any extbase / fluid related questions which don't deal with
EXT:news directly, it is maybe better to use the mailing-list
*typo3.projects.typo3v4mvc* .


Manual
"""""""

The section "Tutorial" in the manual contains various snippets and examples.

If you want to share something (remember: TYPO3 – inspiring people to
share), please add it to the issue tracker and I will add it to the manual.


Private/Personal support
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you need private or personal support, ask one of the developers for it.

**Be aware that this support won't be free!**
