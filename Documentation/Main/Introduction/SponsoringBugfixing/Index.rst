Sponsoring & Bugfixing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nobody is perfect and nothing is complete. Out of those 2 simple
reasons there is still a chance that some bugs made it into your
version of news. If you found a bug, please check the page
`http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-news/issues
<http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-news/issues>`_ if the bug
has already been reported (and maybe even already been fixed) and if
this is not the case please report it there!

Please understand that there are weeks and months with not
that much free time for TYPO3 and this extension. Chances of bugfixes
and implementation of features rises with sponsoring!

Help, especially including patches, is of course always welcome!

Donate
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Donations are one way to show a developer your thankfulness!
Endless hours are being put into this extension to make it possible for you to build awesome sites in no time!
Have a look at the git logs at http://git.typo3.org/TYPO3CMS/Extensions/news.git?a=shortlog to get a proof.

If this extension is part of your offers, it would be awesome to pass a tiny little bit of it back to the original developers!
