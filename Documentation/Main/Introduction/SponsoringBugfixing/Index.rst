Sponsoring & Bugfixing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nobody is perfect and nothing is complete. Out of those 2 simple
reason there is still a chance that some bugs made it into your
version of news. If you found a bug, please check the page
`http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-news/issues
<http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-news/issues>`_ if the bug
has already been reported (and maybe even already been fixed) and if
this is not the case please report it there!

Everyone of the team got already a regular job, wife and plenty of
hobbies. Please understand that there are weeks and months with not
that much free time for TYPO3 and this extension. Chances of bugfixes
and implementation of features rises with sponsoring!

Help, especially including patches, is of course always welcome!
