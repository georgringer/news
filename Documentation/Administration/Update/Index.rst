Updating
--------
If you update EXT:news to a newer version, please read this section carefully!

Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^
EXT:news follows the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ approach.

It uses a 3-number versioning scheme: *<major>.<minor>.<patch>*

- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New functionality, backwards compatible (without breaking changes)
- Patch: Bug fixes (without breaking changes)

Before an update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start the update procedure, please read the changelog of all versions which have been
released in the meantime! You can find those in the manual :ref:`here <changelog>`.

Furthermore it is **always** a good idea to do updates on a dedicated test installation or at least create a database backup.
