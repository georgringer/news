Improved slug handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following changes might be important if you are using news and TYPO3 9:

The slug configuration for `tx_news_domain_model_news` improved by using features of the Core which got merged in version 9.5.4.
The configuration looks now like: ::

   'generatorOptions' => [
      'fields' => ['title'],
      'replacements' => [
          '/' => '-'
      ],
   ],
   'fallbackCharacter' => '-',
   'eval' => 'uniqueInSite',

The fields `tx_news_domain_model_tag` && `sys_category` have been extended by a slug field as well. Upgrade wizards in the Install Tool can be used to fill the slug field.

Additionally a wizard to migrate realurl alias to the slug field has been integrated.
