Category Constraints for FlexForms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The listing of categories inside a news record can be restricted by settings in the Extension Manager. The restriction can now be used in the FlexForm configuration as well by enabling it with TsConfig :typoscript:`tx_news.categoryRestrictionForFlexForms = 1`.
