After a far too long time I managed to get a release out again. 6.1. is compatible with 7.6 LTS and 8 LTS and also supports the development version of 9 as long as the extension **typo3db_legacy** is installed.

Important changes
-----------------

Add a new action "selectedList"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new action makes it possible to render a list of custom selected news items. An editor can choose any amount of news records which are shown in the provided order.

The following changes are worth mentioning.

Configurable filters for the administration module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By using TsConfig it is now possible to hide filters in the administration module. The full configuration is: ::

   tx_news.module {
       filters {
           searchWord = 1
           timeRestriction = 1
           topNewsRestriction = 1
           hidden = 1
           archived = 1
           sortingField = 1
           number = 1
           categories = 1
           categoryConjunction = 1
           includeSubCategories = 1
       }
   }


Page data to fluid templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every frontend fluid template can now access the full row of the current page by checking the variable `pageData`. As an example you will get the page title by using `pageData.title`.
