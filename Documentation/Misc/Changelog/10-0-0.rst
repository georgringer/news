The big cleanup
---------------
The extension "news" is one of the most used extensions and known for its feature richness.
However, to be able to satisfy the need for stable releases and early adoptions to upcoming LTS releases it was necessary to improve and slim the code base. More than 60 issues of the issue tracker have been handled during the development of this release.

Extracting features to separate extensions makes it possible to have a smaller **main code base** with faster releases on the one hand and dedicated releases of extensions providing features on the other hand.

More extensions are planned already!

Extract backend module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The backend module of EXT:news is awesome to manage lots of articles. It has been extracted into an own extension called `news_administration`.

See :ref:`manual for details <newsAdministration>`

Extract tag auto creation via suggest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The possibility of creating tag records on the fly within a news record is an awesome feature. It has been extracted into an own extension called `news_tagsuggest`.

See :ref:`manual for details <newsTagsuggest>`

Rename classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following classes have been renamed:

- `Hooks/DataHandler` => `Hooks/DataHandlerHook`
- `Hooks/BackendUtility` => `Hooks/FlexformHook`

This avoids wrong suggestions of your IDE when checking for `DataHandler` or `BackendUtility`

Features
--------

Configurable slug prefix in backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The slug information is prefixed by default with the current domain. By using the TsConfig `tx_news.slugPrefix` it can be overridden by the path to a page to show the correct slug.

See :ref:`manual for details <tsconfigSlugPrefix>`

Improved events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Couple of events have been improved and added to make it easier to extend EXT:news
