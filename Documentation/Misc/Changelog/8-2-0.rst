Important changes
-----------------

The slug eval configuration of all 3 slug fields (news,tag and category record) is changed from `uniqueInSite` to `unique`.

If you really need `uniqueInSite` you can switch to this setting in the Extension settings in the Install Tool.

**Some further explanation:**

- If `uniqueInSite` is used, news records in multiple sites can have the slug. The drawback is that those news can't be shared between these sites.
- Using `unique` means that news records in multiple sites have always a different slug, no matter if the title is the same or not. Therefore news can be shared between multiple sites.
