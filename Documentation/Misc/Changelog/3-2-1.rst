Drop fe_group field in sys_category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously EXT:news added a field in the table of *sys_category* to add constraints to Frontenduser groups.
However, this constraint was never evaluated in the frontend. Furthermore other extension authors might not respect this additional global constraint.

Therefore this field is removed.

Drop support of rte_enabled checkbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using TYPO3 CMS 7.3+, the checkbox "Disable RTE" is removed because the Core in general doesn't support this concept anymore.
