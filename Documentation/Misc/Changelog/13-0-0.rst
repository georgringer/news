Breaking changes
-----------------

News of hidden storage pages are not rendered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a storage page (e.g., a *sysfolder*) containing news records is set to **hidden**,
the related news records will also **not be rendered**.

This behavior allows editors to quickly show or hide groups of news records by simply toggling the visibility of their storage page.

This also enables editors to quickly hide & unhide news records by changing the
visibility of the storage pages.

Defining template layouts via `$GLOBALS`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Template layouts* which can be selected in the plugin can now only be defined
using *Page TSconfig`. The usage of :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['templateLayouts']` has been removed.

Force cHash for pagination argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The pagination argument `tx_news_pi1[currentPage]` now requires a cHash.
In most setups, this hash is generated automatically, so no manual action is typically needed.

Remove deprecated sitemap option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before the introduction of EXT:seo, sitemaps were created using an `HMENU`.
This legacy code has now been removed, as all sitemap generation should use EXT:seo.

Remove tx_news_domain_model_news_ttcontent_mm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The table `tx_news_domain_model_news_ttcontent_mm` has been once used many versions ago.

As this table is not used anymore, its definition has been removed.

Remove label overlay for categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously, editors could configure a language in their user settings to
dynamically overlay category labels in the backend.

As EXT:news was the only extension implementing such backend label overlays,
this feature has now been removed.

Remove usage of LOAD_REGISTER
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The method :php:`\GeorgRinger\News\Utility\Page::setRegisterProperties` and the related
setting `detail.registerProperties` have been removed.

These were used to populate the ContentObjectRendererâ€™s register with values from news objects.
As this behavior has been obsolete for several versions, and controllers should
not modify the register directly, the functionality was dropped.


Features
--------

Improved support of site sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since version 13, Site sets and site settings are the best way to configure your
site package and extensions.

EXT:news ships now several site sets which allow to configure the extension per site.
Read more about it at: :ref:`configuration-site-set`

One nice feature, especially for smaller sites is to define the detail page only once.

Convert internal + external urls for record links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the record link identifier starts with `tx_news`, the record links to records of the type
"Internal" and "External" are correctly retrieved.

Various other features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Plugin preview in the backend renders the listPid of search actions
- Add event for news list after the pagination has been built
- Allow archiveRestriction to be set in TS and overridable in plugin
