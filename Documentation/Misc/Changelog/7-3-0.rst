Important changes
-----------------

Starting of major refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release is the starting point of next major refactoring project. The main target is to **support TYPO3 9 & 10 LTS**.
Providing support for 2 LTS versions has got the following advantages:
- People using 9 already get the new features
- Upgrade to 10 is therefore easier because it means that the extension is already compatible

So what is it all about:

- *SEO*: Support for MetaTag-API, custom TitleTag-Provider, custom Sitemap-Provider
- *Translations*: With 9 the translations changed a lot, so this needs to be all checked and tested
- *Code adoption*: Fix deprecations, remove code specific to 8
- *Best practice*: The extension is used for a lot of developers as best practice example. Some code parts need to be improved to fit the expectations.
- *Features*: I got a couple of features in my mind as well
- *Breaking changes*: Those won't be many and will be feature like but as those change behaviour those are still breaking.

You can follow the next steps at https://github.com/georgringer/news/projects/3.

Features
--------
The following features have been added.

Custom Sitemap Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A custom sitemap provider `NewsXmlSitemapDataProvider` has been added to improve the sitemaps generated by EXT:seo in version 9.
Read about its configuration in the chapter Best practice > SEO.

XLF Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instead of using the translation server (http://translation.typo3.org) the service https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-extension-news
is being used. The translations are now included in the extension itself.
