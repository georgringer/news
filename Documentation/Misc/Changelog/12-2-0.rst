Important changes
-----------------

Changed behavior for TS settings.search.paginate.itemsPerPage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TypoScript setting `settings.search.paginate.itemsPerPage` has been disabled in the default TypoScript setup.
This makes it possible that the setting provied in the plugin configuration (FlexForms) is used.
However, this uses the default backup of `settings.list.paginate.itemsPerPage`.

Deprecated hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following hooks have been deprecated and will be removed with the next major version:

- `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Domain/Repository/AbstractDemandedRepository.php']['findDemanded']`: use the event `\GeorgRinger\News\Event\ModifyDemandRepositoryEvent`
- `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Controller/NewsController.php']['overrideSettings']`: use the event `\GeorgRinger\News\Event\NewsControllerOverrideSettingsEvent`
- `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Controller/NewsController.php']['createDemandObjectFromSettings']`: use the event `\GeorgRinger\News\Event\CreateDemandObjectFromSettingsEvent`
- `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news'][\GeorgRinger\News\Hooks\PluginPreviewRenderer::class]['extensionSummary']`: use the event `\GeorgRinger\News\Event\PluginPreviewSummaryEvent`

Calling any of the aforementioned hooks will trigger deprecation log entries.

Features
--------

New events
~~~~~~~~~~

Finally the last hooks of the extension are now available as event to follow the best practices of TYPO3 core.

The most used is `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Domain/Repository/AbstractDemandedRepository.php']['findDemanded']` which is used to modify the query to fetch the news records. This is now available as `\GeorgRinger\News\Event\ModifyDemandRepositoryEvent`.

See above for a full list of available events.
