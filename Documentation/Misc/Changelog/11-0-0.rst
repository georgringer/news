11.0.0 - 9th March 2023
=======================

This is the first release of the extension that supports TYPO3 12 and 11.
This also means that the **active** support for TYPO3 10 (EXT:news v9) has been stopped.

Breaking changes
-----------------
Even though a new major version has been released, there is only one important change which has a couple of various consequences:

Split plugins into separate plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the removal of the so called "SwitchableControllerActions" in TYPO3 12, the plugin of EXT:news has been splitted into separate plugins.
This means that every selection in the former flexform field "*What to display*" is now a separate plugin.

An updated wizard in the Install Tool is available to migrate the plugins to the new plugins.

Permission configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Due to the plugin splitting, the access permissions must be adopted as not only the plugin `news_pi1` must be allowed but all various plugins an editor is allowed to use.

An updated wizard in the Install Tool is available to migrate the permissions to the new plugins.

Changed plugin registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using the field `CType` with `list` and `list_type` with `news_pi1, only the field `CType` is now used:

- `news_pi1`: article list view + detail view
- `news_newsliststicky`: article list view with doesn't switch to a detail view
- `news_newsdetail`: article detail view
- `news_newsselectedlist`: selected list of articles
- `news_newsdatemenu`: date menu of articles
- `news_newssearchform`: search form
- `news_newssearchresult`: search result
- `news_categorylist`: category listing
- `news_taglist`: tag listing

Please adopt your code if you e.g. select plugins based on the `CType` or if modify the TCA of the plugin element.


Features
--------

Improved routing
----------------

With the change `b8e2b3ea` the routing configuration has been simplified.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # before
   aspects:
     news-title:
        type: PersistedAliasMapper
        tableName: tx_news_domain_model_news
        routeFieldName: path_segment
        type: NewsTitle


   # now
   aspects:
      news-title:
        type: NewsTitle

Additionally, if a record can't be retrieved for the given slug (e.g. because it has been deleted), the controller can now show the fallback again.


Optional namespaces for plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a result, the plugins can now also be configured more independently from each other by using the **optional** custom namespaces:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   plugin {
      tx_news_newsliststicky.settings {
         myCustomSetting = 1
      }

      tx_news_newsdetail.settings {}
      tx_news_newsselectedlist.settings {}
      tx_news_newsdatemenu.settings {}
      tx_news_categorylist.settings {}
      tx_news_newssearchform.settings {}
      tx_news_newssearchresult.settings {}
      tx_news_taglist.settings {}
   }

Support of PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PostgreSQL is now supported as database backend.
This means that the extension can be used with PostgreSQL as well as MySQL and MariaDB.
