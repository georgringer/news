Upgrade procedure
-----------------
The following changes might break your installation but all are easy to solve.

Change of proxy-class generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you use the feature of EXT:news to extend any class by providing a file called ``Resources/Private/extend-news.txt``,
be aware that the implementation and registration changed! Basically all you need is to add the following code to your ``ext_localconf.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   defined('TYPO3_MODE') or die();

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['classes']['Domain/Model/News'][] = 'eventnews';

Please take a look at the  :ref:`documentation <proxyClassGenerator>` where it is explained in detail.


Usage of namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The extension uses now fully namespaces which meant touching every PHP class at least once!
The used vendor name is ``GeorgRinger``!

Rename some hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following files and classes have been renamed:

- ``Hooks/T3libBefunc`` into ``Hooks/BackendUtility``
- ``Hooks/Tcemain`` into ``Hooks/DataHandler``
- ``Hooks/CmsLayout`` into ``Hooks/PageLayoutView``
- ``Hooks/Tceforms`` into ``Hooks/FormEngine``

The registration of the hook ``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Hooks/T3libBefunc.php']['updateFlexforms']`` changed into ``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['news']['Hooks/BackendUtility.php']['updateFlexforms']`` .

If you use one of these files, change the name to the new version.

Dropping the mm table for tt_content relations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   This is only relevant if you use the flag **Use content element relation** which needs to be set
   in the configuration inside the *Extension Manager*.

Previously, tt_content elements have been added by using the mm relation table ``tx_news_domain_model_news_ttcontent_mm`` which had some drawbacks.
The usage of this table is now dropped which means that after updating, you need to run the Update Wizard in the *Install Tool* to migrate the relations.

The Upgrade Wizard is called **EXT:news Migrate from tt_content mm relation**.

Dropping t3blog importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The code to import records and categories of the extension *t3blog* has been moved to a separate extension. You can find that here: https://github.com/georgringer/t3ext-news_import_t3blog

Important changes
-----------------

A lot of code changed in this version. The most important changes are:

* A new index has been added to the database table ``tx_news_domain_model_news`` to improve the performance of translated records.
* The documentation uses now a separate git repositories which is located on GitHub. This makes it easier for everyone to contribute a better documentation. The repository is located here: https://github.com/georgringer/news-documentation
