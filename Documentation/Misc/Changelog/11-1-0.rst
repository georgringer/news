Important features
------------------

Support of SlidingWindowPagination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`SlidingWindowPagination` is a pagination implementation since TYPO3 v12 which is identical to the pagination brought to you by https://packagist.org/packages/georgringer/numbered-pagination.

The new pagination is now also supported within EXT:news

Support if in dataprocessors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more flexibility (and avoidance of overhead/errors), the `if` property allows limiting DataProcessors to specific situations (e.g. the presence of a newId via `if.isTrue.data = GP:tx_news_pi1|news`).
