======
Plugin
======

The news plugin is used to output a defined list of records.

It can be added to create a content element with the type
:guilabel:`Plugin` and by selecting the plugin type :guilabel:`News system`.

.. TODO: screenshot

.. only:: html

   The available actions are:

   .. contents::
        :local:
        :depth: 1

.. _plugin-list:

List
^^^^
The list action displays a list of defined records. The filters can be defined either in the plugin or by using TypoScript and are described :ref:`here <ts>`.

2 different list modes are available.

List view
"""""""""

If a plugin is configured to show this implementation of the list action, it will change its behaviour if the URL contains a link to a detail action!
If this is fulfilled, the detail action will be shown instead of the list action.

List view (without overloading detail view)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The described behaviour of the first implementation might not be desired all the time.
A typical example is to show a list view in the sidebar of a detail view page. If the above action would be used, the detail view would be shown in the sidebar too.

List of articles
""""""""""""""""
Show a specific list of articles

.. _plugin-detail:

Detail
^^^^^^
There are 2 typical use cases for this action:

- Use this action to show a full news record which is linked by a list view.
- Provide a specific news record to output that one. This is very useful to embed a news record e.g. in a newsletter.

.. _plugin-dateMenu:

Date menu
^^^^^^^^^
Use this action to show a list of news items grouped by the date. A typical output can look like: ::

   2015
      January: 13 entries
      February: 9 entries
      March: 6 entries
      June: 4 entries
      ...
   2014
      March: 81 entries
      April: 32 entries
      May: 1 entry


If you define a specific page id in field :guilabel:`PageId for list display` (inside the tab :guilabel:`Additional`) and
placing a news plugin with the type :guilabel:`List` there, it is possible to create a date filter.

.. _plugin-searchForm:

Search form
^^^^^^^^^^^
Use this action to show a basic search inside news records.

.. _plugin-searchResult:

Search result
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The search result action is based on the list action including an additional filter provided by the search form.

.. _plugin-categoryList:

Category menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use this action to show a list of categories. The categories are listed as tree.

If you define a specific page id in field :guilabel:`PageId for list display` (inside the tab "*Additional*") and
placing a news plugin with the type :guilabel:`List` there, it is possible to create a category filter.

.. _plugin-tagList:

Tag list
^^^^^^^^
Use this action to show a list of tags.

If you define a specific page id in field :guilabel:`PageId for list display` (inside the tab "*Additional*") and
placing a news plugin with the type :guilabel:`List` there, it is possible to create a tag filter.
